# Meshtastic GUI

A Python-based GUI application for interacting with Meshtastic devices, built using flet and the Meshtastic Python API. This project aims to provide a user-friendly desktop alternative to the official Meshtastic clients, eventually offering the same functionality as the iOS, Android, and web clients, in an offline-capable, native desktop form.
